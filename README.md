A learning exercise in Go. Uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a 
random string into the user's input. 

#Algorithm outline
1. Generate random initial population
2. Calculate each fitness
3. Randomly select 2 candidates, the fitter becomes a parent
4. Breen consecutive parents to produce new generation
5. Recalculate fitnesses
6. Repeat until the fittest is perfect
